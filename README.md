This figure shows how the distribution of the maximum of n indepndent Gaussian random variables changes with n. It says that, as n grows large, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\max_i X_i"> will be less than <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt{2.1 \log n}"> with high probability.
